# 🧠 ML Practice Lab

This repository contains my hands-on Machine Learning experiments, datasets, and model implementations as I learn AI/ML step by step.

## 🚀 Goals
- Build strong ML fundamentals
- Practice with real-world datasets
- Implement models from scratch
- Track my journey publicly

## 📂 Structure
- `linear_regression/` → Regression experiments
- `logistic_regression/` → Classification experiments
